This is a full-stack React-based app that uses Express.js and the Axios.js library to make HTTP requests and pull from the NYTimes API. The data is then displayed within React components and the user may save articles that they like into a MongoDB database. Saved articles can be clicked into for additional article information as well as deleted from the client database.
